Why do we give talks? And more importantly—why should you? In this session, we’ll take a step back and align ourselves with what it is we are here to do. We’ll discuss how giving talks can grow your confidence, sharpen your thinking, and even open professional doors. This isn’t about being perfect—it’s about participating. Whether you’re nervous, unsure, or just not convinced you have something worth saying, Zeke’s here to make the case: your talk matters, and the group needs your voice.
