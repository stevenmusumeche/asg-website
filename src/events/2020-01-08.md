Ignite talks are 20 slides, auto-advancing every 15 seconds and only 5 minutes long. They can be on any topic. Ignite talks are a great chance to share ideas that wouldn't typically take up a full talk. It's also a way to dip your toe into public speaking (anyone can bomb for 5 minutes). Here's the expected lineup.

- Vulkan in 5 mins – Chris Parich
- Don’t Discount the Developer – Tales from the Technical Dark Side – Mike Miller
- Know your Audience – Brian Stanford
- Intro to –ilities – Davin Smith
- Improving Web Performance with Responsive Images – Steven Musumeche
- Avoiding Burnout – Kristin Parich
